2. Ensure project3.fsx is included in the compile in .fsproj file
3. Through the command line, run the program using the command :
dotnet fsi --langversion:preview project3.fsx numNodes numRequests
(providing different values for numNodes and numRequests)

## Working Part :

<ul>
<li>The protocol is implemented as per the Pastry paper. Pastry API described are called within the program.</li>
<li>The program runs correctly for ..</li>
<li>The program terminates exactly when all the nodes have made the given number of requests.</li>  
<li>As per the requirements, the average number of hops or node connections is calculated and printed on the console.</li>
<li>All the requirements for the project are met and have successfully implemented the protocol.</li>
</ul>

## Largest network managed to deal with :

Largest network that could be managed consisted of 1000 peers and each peer was able to make 100 requests for which we obtained average number of hops as 2.58.
